## Math Formulas in Markdown

This platform supports math formulas using LaTeX syntax.

### Inline Formulas

For example, the formula for energy is $E = mc^2$.

### Block Formulas

You can also write block formulas:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

### Complex Formulas

Here's a more complex example:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx = \frac{b^3}{3} - \frac{a^3}{3}
$$

## Using Headings Effectively

Headings help structure your content. For example:

### Section 1

This is the first section.

#### Subsection 1.1

This is a subsection.

### Section 2

This is the second section.

## Conclusion

Markdown is very useful and easy to use! Explore the features of this blog to create engaging and interactive posts.
