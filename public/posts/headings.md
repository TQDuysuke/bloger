# Using Headings Effectively

Headings help structure your content and make it easier to read.

## Syntax

Use `#` for headings:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

## Example

### Section 1

This is the first section.

#### Subsection 1.1

This is a subsection.

### Section 2

This is the second section.

## Best Practices

- Use headings to create a clear hierarchy.
- Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g., don't jump from `#` to `###`).
- Keep headings concise and descriptive.
